Project Name : Student Mental Health Analysis Dashboard using SQL Server and Tableau

This project focuses on analyzing mental health patterns among students using structured survey data. The backend data preparation was done using SQL Server, where cleaning, transformation, and categorization were applied. The cleaned data was then visualized through an interactive Tableau dashboard to derive meaningful insights on depression and related factors such as academic pressure, sleep duration, and financial stress.

Tools and Technologies Used:

1. SQL Server – For data cleaning, transformation, and analysis
2. Tableau Desktop – For data visualization and dashboard development
3. Excel – Original data source

Project Highlights:

1. Cleaned and standardized raw data in SQL Server (e.g., unified gender labels, mapped depression values).
2. Created new fields such as Age Groups (A1, A2, A3) based on age distribution using SQL CASE logic.
3. Imported the cleaned SQL data into Tableau through a direct SQL Server connection.
4. Built an interactive Tableau dashboard to visualize key mental health indicators among students, including:
5. Depression status across age groups and gender
6. Impact of academic pressure, financial stress, and sleep duration
7. Trends in suicidal thoughts and study hour patterns

Dashboard Overview:

1. The Tableau dashboard provides:
2. Bar charts and bubble plots to visualize mental health indicators
3. Filters and grouped views to analyze demographic and behavioral trends
4. Insightful correlations between depression and external student stressors
